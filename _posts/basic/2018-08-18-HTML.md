The latest version of Typora already supports normal HTML tags. 

Inline HTML tags, such as `<span>` and `<sup>`, will be rendered immediately after you input their closing tag. This is the same as other Markdown syntax, such as `**` or `__`. Other supported tags are rendered in a separate block and you can switch between the output and HTML source code easily, just like math blocks.

For security purposes, no scripts are supported, no matter if you use `<script>` or `onload` attributes. `class`, `id`, and `data-*` are also not supported. Scripts are allowed inside an `<iframe>` but it will wrapped with `sandbox` attributes and would have no access to your writing content nor local files.

You can find more details in the following sections.

## Inline HTML

Typora can render inline HTML the same as normal inline Markdown styles, for example: 

| Raw Markdown Source                                          | Output in Live Preview                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<span style='color:red'>This is red</span>`                 | <span style='color:red'>This is red</span>                   |
| `<ruby> 漢 <rt> ㄏㄢˋ </rt> </ruby>`                         | <ruby> 漢 <rt> ㄏㄢˋ </rt> </ruby>                           |
| `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>`                              | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>                                |
| `<span style="font-size:2rem; background:yellow;">**Bigger**</span>` | <span style="font-size:2rem; background:yellow;">**Bigger**</span> |
| `HTML entities like &reg; &#182;`                            | HTML entities like &reg; &#182;                              |

The writing experience is also the same:

<video src="/media/html/inline HTML.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto;" autoplay loop preload muted></video>
For easier editing purposes, Typora will show empty tags or HTML with `display:none` styles. For example, related content in the following Markdown will be visible in Typora but invisible after exporting.

```markdown
## <a name="anchor"></a> Header 2

<span style="display:none">I am hidden after export</span>
```

## HTML Entities

You can use [HTML entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) directly in Typora, for example:

`&frac14;` → &frac14;, `&#x1D517;` → &#x1D517; 

But we recommend to input their unicode directly, which is more readable and compatible. 

## HTML Block

Block level HTML tags and "invisible" tags (such as `script`, `meta`, etc) in a Markdown document will be rendered as an HTML Block, for example:

```html
<details>
    <summary>I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter but can't leave. What am I?</summary>
    A keyboard.
</details>
```

Will be rendered as:

<details>
    <summary>I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter but can't leave. What am I?</summary>
    A keyboard.
</details>
An HTML Block can enter edit mode by moving the cursor inside it, by clicking it in a non-interactive part or by using <kbd>Command</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click.

Markdown syntax will not be parsed inside HTML blocks, which is the same for GFM/CommonMark.

For easier editing purposes, some inline tags, such as `svg` may also use the same editing behavior of those block level HTML tags.

Typora does not show a preview for "invisible" tags, such as `<script>`, `<meta>` and `<style>`, but only shows their raw source.

## Media and Embedded Contents

### Video

You can embed a video like this:

```Markdown
<video src="xxx.mp4" />
```

Or drag & drop a video file into Typora, and Typora will insert the video automatically.

The path of `Video` follows the same rule as for images. So, the option "Use relative path as possible" and "image root path" also applies to `<video>` content.

### Audio

As with with `<video>`, you can use the `<audio>` tag to embed an audio file:

```markdown
<audio src="xxx.mp3" />
```

### Embed Web Contents

Some websites allow you to embed their contents into other webpages, most of them support `<iframe>`, which is also supported by Typora. You can just follow their "sharing" page/dialog and paste their code into Typora, e.g:

```markdown
<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='Fancy Animated SVG Menu' src='//codepen.io/jeangontijo/embed/OxVywj/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/jeangontijo/pen/OxVywj/'>Fancy Animated SVG Menu</a> by Jean Gontijo (<a href='https://codepen.io/jeangontijo'>@jeangontijo</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
```

which will become

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='Fancy Animated SVG Menu' src='//codepen.io/jeangontijo/embed/OxVywj/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/jeangontijo/pen/OxVywj/'>Fancy Animated SVG Menu</a> by Jean Gontijo (<a href='https://codepen.io/jeangontijo'>@jeangontijo</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

Some websites only provide a Javascript-based embed code, instead of an `<iframe>` snippet, for example:

```markdown
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sunsets don&#39;t get much better than this one over <a href="https://twitter.com/GrandTetonNPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GrandTetonNPS</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nature?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#nature</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sunset?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sunset</a> <a href="http://t.co/YuKy2rcjyU">pic.twitter.com/YuKy2rcjyU</a></p>&mdash; US Department of the Interior (@Interior) <a href="https://twitter.com/Interior/status/463440424141459456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

Typora only supports some script-based sharing code, and this content and/or scripts will also be running in a sandbox iframe with no access to your local files and writing content.

We could consider allowing users to configure the "*whitelist*" for this kind in future updates.

### <del>PDF</del>

No longer supported, you may try online file viewers instead, such as examples in https://gist.github.com/tzmartin/1cf85dc3d975f94cfddc04bc0dd399be.

## Comments

Typora supports HTML comments, using syntax `<!-- comments --> `, e.g:

```markdown
<!-- I am some comments
not end, not end...
here the comment ends -->
```

They are invisible when exporting/printing.

## `<Strong>` or `**` ?

Please use Markdown syntax instead of original HTML tags, since Markdown is easier to input and also better supported by Typora. 

## Limitations

- In HTML Block, no empty line is allowed or it will be rendered as two HTML Blocks.
- Only common/normal HTML tags will be rendered as HTML content in Typora. Custom tags, like `<application>`, `<my-custom-component>` will be ignored (They will be included when exporting/printing).
- Not all attributes are supported. `id`, `class`, `data-*` and unknown attributes in HTML will not be included when rendering (They will be included when exporting/printing).
- Scripts are basically not allowed. `<style>` and `<meta>` won't be applied either (They will be included when exporting/printing).
- Not all HTML tags/styles can be exported to other formats. Exporting to PDF, HTML or HTML-compatible formats (such as EPub) would keep their HTML content, but exporting to other formats, such as Word or LaTeX, their HTML content may become plain text.
