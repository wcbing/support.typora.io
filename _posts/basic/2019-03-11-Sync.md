## Data Sync

Typora uses the Markdown format, storing work in plain text files. Therefore, you can use any 3rd party sync tools, such as iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox and others, to sync your files across devices.

## Mobile Support

We are currently focusing on the desktop version of Typora, so there won't be a mobile version of Typora in the near future.

To edit files on Mobile, you could choose any Markdown editor that supports iCloud Drive or other 3rd party cloud sync / storage tools, such as

- Pretext
- MWeb
- 1Writer
- ByWord
- iA Writer
- Editorial
- ... or search for "Markdown" in the App Store or on Google Play.
