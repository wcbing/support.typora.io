Typora is deeply integrated with the macOS desktop environment, like other native apps on macOS. The simplicity and extendable functions provided by macOS are also available in Typora.

## System

### Apple Silicon

Typora is now native on Apple Silicon Mac devices.

### Open From Terminal 

You can use `open -a typora xxx.md` to open the Markdown file `xxx.md` in Typora from a command line. If Typora is your default editor for `.md` files, then `open xxx.md` would be enough.

You can also add

```sh
alias typora="open -a typora"
```

in your `.bash_profile` or other configuration file which then means you would be able to simply type `typora xxx.md` instead.

For details, you can [click here](https://support.typora.io/Use-Typora-From-Shell-or-cmd/).

### Quick Look

Typora does not provide a quick look plugin for now but you can use [QLMarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown) or [Glance](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/glance) to achieve this.

### Older macOS Support

The latest version of Typora supports macOS ≥ 11.0, for older macOS support, please check https://support.typora.io/Older-macOS-Support/.

## File

### Document-Based App

Typora is a documented-base app, so for macOS, the system provides built-in functions like **[auto-save](https://support.typora.io/Auto-Save/), [version control](https://support.typora.io/Version-Control/), quickly renaming from title bar**, etc.

For example, you can use <kbd>command</kbd> + click on the titlebar to quickly open parent folders of the current file in Typora (and in other macOS apps as well):

<video src="/media/macOS/titlebar.mp4" controls style="width:100%"> </video>

### Version Control and Recovery

On macOS, Typora integrates with the native version control function powered by the operation system.

You can simply choose `File` > `Revert To` > `Browse All Versions` from the main menu to browse and revert to a certain version. More details can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40710/mac).

For **untitled** drafts, they are located in `~/Library/Autosave Information`. But please save them just in case.

### Share

You can share a file from `File` → `Share` in the menu.

## Editing

### Grammar and Spelling Checker

Typora uses the macOS built-in grammar and spelling checker, you can enable / disable it in system preferences or from the menu bar.

You can also learn spellings from the context menu and the learned new words will be shared among different macOS apps.

### Substitutions

Typora supports macOS built-in text functions like: 

- **smart quote**
- **smart dashes**
-  **text replacement**
- **capitalize words automatically**
- **add period with double space**

You can configure them under system preferences.

After configuring, text substitution will be working in Typora. For features like smart dashes, smart quote and text replacement, you can also enable / disable them from Typora’s `Edit` → `Substitutions` menu.

### Services

You can use [service](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2476298/os-x-a-quick-guide-to-services-on-your-mac.html) to extend Typora’s functionality before Typora has its own plugin system.

For example, you can install [WordService](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordservice/id899972312?mt=12) for common text operations, such as insert date and time, etc.

Including to change block / inline styles, modify tables (add row, etc), change list indent, input predictions, etc.

### Dictionary Look Up / Link Preview

You can tap with three fingers on the trackpad to look up words or preview links, just like in Safari. You can find details [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl3983326c/mac).

### Dark Mode

Typora will use the system dark mode color scheme when using dark themes. Or, if you want Typora to auto apply themes based on the current macOS light / dark mode, you can choose different themes for light mode and dark mode.
