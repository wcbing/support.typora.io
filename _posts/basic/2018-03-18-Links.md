## Basic Syntax

#### Hyperlink

```markdown
[Link Text](link-address)

[Link Text](link-address "optional title")
```

Protocols like `http://` cannot be omitted for this type of syntax.

#### Reference Link

```markdown
[Link Text][Ref]

[Ref]: link-address "optional title"
```

Or, it can be shortened, as shown below.

```markdown
[Ref][]

[Ref]: link-address
```

Protocols like `http://` cannot be omitted for this type of syntax.

#### Autolink

```markdown
<http://typora.io>
```

#### Auto URL

Typora can automatically detect a URL link in Markdown, and render them as URL link, but please note that other Markdown engines may not support this.

```markdown
This is a link: http://typora.io
```

#### HTML `<a>` tag

You can also use raw HTML to add links, for example:

```html
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="__blank">Link to Google</a>

<a name="anchor"></a> Anchor

<a href="#anchor">Link to Anchor</a>
```

For a link towards a website, we suggest you **DO NOT omit URL protocols** like `https://` or `http://` as it may be interpreted as a relative link by Typora or other Markdown engines, including after exporting/publishing. 

## Link to Local Files

You can use a relative or absolute path as a link address pointing towards a local file. The extension, like *.md*, can be omitted. For example:

```markdown
[Readme1](Readme1.md)

[Readme2](../Docs/Readme2.markdown)

[Readme3](Readme3)

[Readme4](/User/root/Docs/Readme1.md)

[Readme4](C:/Develop/Docs/Readme1.md)

[Readme4](file:///User/root/Docs/Readme1.md)
```

Please note that, for a relative link address, it will not be converted into a real absolute file path when exporting as HTML based on Markdown's spec. 

You can also link to chapters in other files, for example:

```gfm
[Readme1](Readme1.md#header-1)
```

This would open “Header 1” of `Readme1.md` file when opening the link.

## Internal Links

You can use `#` to create links towards any headings in your Markdown file, for example:

```markdown
# This is a title

...
...
...


A [link](#this-is-a-title) to jump towards target heading
```

If there are <span id="duplicated-headings">duplicated headings</span>, add a numbered suffix starting from `-1`, e.g:

```markdown
# Hello

...

# Hello

...

A [link](#hello-1) to first heading, a [link](#hello-2) to second one.
```



You can also write **named** anchors using raw HTML:

```html
<a id="anchor"></a> Anchor

<a href="#anchor">Link to Anchor</a>
```

To hide the empty `<a>`, you could add the following in custom CSS ([#2921](https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/2921)):

```css
/* hide the anchor HTML */
a[name]:empty + .md-raw-inline {
  display:none;
}
a[name]:empty {
  text-decoration: none;
}
a[name]:empty:before {
 content:"⚓";
}
/* show the anchor HTML when cursor is inside */
.md-expand .md-raw-inline {
    display: inline !important;
}
```

## Open Links in Typora

You can use <kbd>Command</kbd>+Click (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+Click (Linux/Windows) on links in Typora to jump to target headings, open them in Typora or open in related apps.

## FAQ

##### Error "Cannot open location `/abc.com`, do you mean [http://abc.com](#) ?" shows when I try to open the link

If you want to make a link to a local file named `abd.com`, please make ensure the path is correct.

If you want to create a link towards a website named "abc.com", you need to put the URL scheme or protocol, for example use `[link](http://abc.com)`. 

Sometimes, protocol can be omitted if you use autolink (`<www.google.com>`) or auto URL (`www.google.com`), but this rule varies across different Markdown editors/engines, so we recommend you DO NOT omit protocols for fewer compatibility issues.

##### Cannot open location `file.md`, would you want to create file at `folder/file.md` and continue?

If you add a link to a local file but the target file does not exist, this tooltip will show and guide you to create a file at the target location.
