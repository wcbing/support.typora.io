## New

### Code Block Math

You enable `Code Block Math` in `Preferences Panel` → `Markdown` → `Code Block Math` to enable support for Gitlab / GitHub style math block (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#math>) with following syntax:

~~~gfm
```math
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
```
~~~

It renders as:

Please note that Typora also support inline math like `$a+b$` and math block like:

~~~gfm
$$
a+b
$$
~~~

## Improvements

### EPub Export

Epub export now adds a "Chapter Level in Outline" option, you could now specify the number of section levels to include in the table of contents. The default is 3 (which means that level-1, 2, and 3 headings will be listed in the contents).

### Header Anchor Spec

For a bookmark link to a heading in the *current* file, use a hash symbol followed by the lowercase words of the heading. Remove punctuation from the heading and replace spaces with dashes. 

Previously Typora will remove most western punctuation, while remains some Unicode punctuation, now Typora will follow following spec:

```
convert heading string to lowercase words
keep - (hyphen)
replace whitespace with - (hyphen)
convert en dash to -- 
convert em hash to ---
remove other punctuation 
```
